# Churn-Analysis-Dashboard
### Situation

Retaining customers is a critical challenge for businesses, particularly in competitive markets. Many organizations struggle to identify at-risk customers before they churn, leading to lost revenue and higher acquisition costs. Existing tools for churn prediction often lack actionable insights and user-friendly visualizations.

### Task

To address this issue, I developed a Power BI dashboard that predicts churn rates using machine learning and provides actionable insights to reduce customer attrition. My role in the project included developing the random forest model, integrating the data, and designing the dashboard.

### Action

I utilized the following tools and techniques to create the churn prediction dashboard:

- **Machine Learning**: Implemented a Random Forest model in Python to predict customer churn based on historical data.

- **Data Processing**: Utilized libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn to preprocess data and train the model.
- **Data Visualization**: Designed a Power BI dashboard to present key insights, such as churn likelihood, influential factors, and customer segmentation.
- **Integration**: Exported model predictions and imported them into Power BI for visualization.

Key features of the dashboard include:

- **Churn Probability by Customer Segment**: Identifies at-risk customers by segment and displays their predicted likelihood of churning.
- **Top Factors Contributing to Churn**: Highlights key drivers influencing churn rates using feature importance from the Random Forest model.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides tailored strategies to retain at-risk customers, such as discounts or loyalty programs.

### Result

The dashboard enabled businesses to take proactive steps in reducing churn and improving customer retention. Quantifiable results include:

- Reduced customer churn by 20% on average after implementing retention strategies derived from the dashboard.
- Increased retention campaign ROI by 30% due to targeted interventions.
- Enhanced decision-making with actionable insights from the dashboard, as reported by 85% of users.

### Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of combining machine learning with intuitive visualizations to drive impactful business decisions. In the future, I aim to explore more advanced algorithms and improve real-time integration for even greater predictive accuracy and usability
